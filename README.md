```
## Code
In the `First Exercise( Project_1)` we implemented a database with extendible hashing.<br>
In the `Second Exercise( Project_2)` we developed the previous part by adding secondary indexes.



## Project Objective
You can find the project objective for the second part [here.](


## Compilation
If you want to run the code, Change Project(1 or 2):
```
cd Project_(i), i = 1,2
make run
